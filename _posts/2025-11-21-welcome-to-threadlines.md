# Welcome to Threadlines

This is your first blog post! This post demonstrates the basic structure of a Jekyll blog post.

## What is Jekyll?

Jekyll is a static site generator that transforms plain text into beautiful static websites and blogs. It's perfect for GitHub Pages and offers:

- **Simple**: No databases, comment moderation, or pesky updates to install
- **Fast**: Static HTML pages are incredibly fast to load
- **Secure**: No database means no security vulnerabilities
- **Flexible**: Markdown, Liquid templating, and more

## Getting Started

You can write posts in Markdown, which makes formatting text simple and intuitive. Here's what you can do:

### Code Blocks

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, Threadlines!")
```

### Lists

- Item one
- Item two
- Item three

### Links and Images

You can add [links](https://jekyllrb.com/) and images easily.

## What's Next?

Start writing your own posts in the `_posts` directory. Each post should follow the naming convention: `YYYY-MM-DD-post-title.md`

Happy blogging!
