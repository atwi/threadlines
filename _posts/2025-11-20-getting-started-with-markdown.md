# Getting Started with Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that makes it easy to format text for the web. Here's a quick guide to get you started.

## Basic Formatting

**Bold text** is created with double asterisks or underscores.

*Italic text* uses single asterisks or underscores.

You can also combine ***bold and italic***.

## Headers

Use `#` symbols for headers. One `#` is the largest, six `######` is the smallest.

## Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote. Use the `>` symbol to create them.
> They're great for highlighting important text or quotations.

## Code

Inline code uses `backticks`, while code blocks use triple backticks:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

## Lists

### Unordered Lists

- First item
- Second item
  - Nested item
  - Another nested item
- Third item

### Ordered Lists

1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

## Links and Images

Create links with `[text](url)` syntax: [Jekyll Documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/)

Images work similarly: `![alt text](image-url)`

## Tables

| Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Row 1    | Data     | More data|
| Row 2    | Data     | More data|

## Conclusion

Markdown is powerful yet simple. Practice these basics, and you'll be writing beautiful content in no time!
