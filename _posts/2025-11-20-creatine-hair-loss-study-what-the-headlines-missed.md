There's been a lot of attention around a new 2025 randomized controlled trial that looked directly at creatine supplementation and hair loss. Media outlets, fitness influencers, and Reddit threads everywhere have largely boiled the study down to a simple takeaway:

**"Creatine doesn't cause hair loss."**

The study does offer valuable data. It's the first trial to pair blood androgen measurements with direct, dermatologist-evaluated hair metrics. And importantly, it did not replicate the results of the 2009 rugby study that reported a sharp spike in DHT after creatine loading.

But after reading the paper closely, and hearing from the authors, there's one key methodological detail that is being overlooked, and it matters a lot for how broadly the results can be applied.

Before getting to that, let's briefly cover what the study actually did show.

## What the Study Found (and Why It Actually Is Good Evidence for Some People)

Forty-five resistance-trained men were randomized to 5 g/day creatine or placebo for 12 weeks. They kept their normal diets and training, and underwent:

- Blood tests (total T, free T, DHT)
- Trichogram tests
- FotoFinder hair density/thickness imaging

The results were straightforward:

### Hormones

- Total testosterone increased over 12 weeks (in both creatine and placebo).
- Free testosterone decreased (also in both groups).
- DHT did not change significantly.
- DHT:T ratio decreased over time.
- DHT:free T ratio increased, but only because free T dropped — not because DHT rose.

These hormone shifts were similar in the creatine and placebo groups.

### Hair metrics

Across all measured hair outcomes:

- Hair density
- Hair count
- Anagen %
- Telogen %
- Terminal vs vellus proportions
- Cumulative hair shaft thickness
- Follicular units

…the study found **no change over 12 weeks** and **no difference between creatine and placebo**.

The authors also ran rank-based analyses, outlier sensitivity checks, and multiple statistical corrections. Nothing changed.

This is a well-designed study with very strong internal validity.

It provides evidence that:

- Creatine at 5 g/day doesn't raise serum DHT,
- And doesn't reduce hair density or thickness,
- (In the specific men who were studied.)

The rugby DHT spike looks even more like a fluke in light of this.

But here's the part that most sources haven't talked about:

## Who Was Actually Allowed to Participate in This Study?

### The Key Detail: The Study Excluded All Signs of AGA — Even Mild Miniaturization

The paper lists this exclusion criterion:

> "Dermatological or systemic conditions known to influence hair loss, such as alopecia areata or thyroid disorders."

It's ambiguous whether this includes androgenetic alopecia (AGA), so I reached out to the study authors for clarification.

They responded that:

**Every participant was "examined in person by a dermatologist before entering the study, and any signs of androgenetic alopecia (even early-stage or mild miniaturization) were grounds for exclusion."**

That means:

- Not just men *diagnosed* with AGA were excluded
- But men with any degree of miniaturization
- Including subtle signs many men already have in their 20s

In other words, the study population consisted only of men with no clinical or even early signs of AGA.

## Why This Screening Choice Limits the Study's External Validity

### 1. AGA requires genetic susceptibility

Some men simply do not have the genetic predisposition for AGA. If you remove everyone with that susceptibility, you remove the only group capable of showing androgen-dependent miniaturization.

### 2. Some substances worsen AGA only in predisposed follicles

Not every compound that can accelerate hair loss does so by raising serum DHT.

For example, many anabolic-androgenic steroids (AAS) don't increase DHT at all. 

Yet many AAS still cause major shedding in men predisposed to AGA, while men without that predisposition often keep perfect hair even on strong androgens

If you tested those AAS only in men with no genetic predisposition for balding, you might conclude they don't affect hair.

Obviously, creatine is not an AAS. And the study results suggest it doesn't significantly increase DHT, which is the primary driver of AGA in most men. 

But to the extent that you believe creatine might worsen AGA through some mechanism other than DHT in men predisposed to AGA, the study doesn't do much to determine that. 

### 3. Most AGA starts before men notice it

A large number of men already have mild miniaturization in their 20s, even if their hair "looks fine."

Excluding all miniaturization means:

- No early AGA
- And quite possibly no or very few men genetically primed for androgen-sensitive hair loss

### 4. So the study answers one question clearly — and another not at all

The study provides strong evidence that creatine doesn't cause hair loss or raise DHT in men who do not have AGA, at least over a 12 week period. 

But it *doesn't* address whether creatine accelerates AGA in men with existing AGA, because those men were explicitly excluded.

## What the Study Does Help Clarify

Even with the external validity limitation, this study meaningfully reduces anxiety for many people.

It shows:

- The DHT increase found in the rugby study was probably just a fluke
- Creatine probably does not increase systemic androgens in a way relevant to AGA
- Any potential risk for predisposed individuals — if one exists — is likely to be modest

## So What Should You Do if You're Worried About Hair Loss?

Here's the practical way to think about it:

**If you have no signs of AGA and no strong family history:**  
The study actually applies to you. Creatine likely won't cause hair loss.

**If you already have AGA or are predisposed:**  
The study simply doesn't answer that question. Creatine is probably a minor factor at most, but personal monitoring matters more than online anecdotes.

**Regardless of predisposition:**

- If you're worried, monitor your average shedding over a few weeks before starting creatine, and monitor whether and how it changes after you start
- If shedding increases noticeably, you can stop
- If you're concerned about hair loss in general, FDA-approved treatments matter far more than tweaking creatine intake

## Conclusion

The new study is a high-quality trial and adds something legitimately valuable to the creatine–hair discussion. It strongly suggests that creatine:

- Does not raise DHT
- Does not worsen hair outcomes in men without AGA

But because the researchers screened out anyone with even mild signs of androgenetic alopecia — a fact the authors confirmed directly — the results tell us nothing about men who are genetically predisposed to male pattern baldness.

For many people, this study should be reassuring.  
For others, it simply means the question isn't fully settled yet.

Either way, the study is a step forward — just not quite the sweeping answer many people assumed.
